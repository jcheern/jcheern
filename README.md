Hi, I’m @jcheern (Jared Heern), a PhD candidate in Political Science at George Washington Univeristy. 
I'm on GitHub because I conduct most of my statistical analysis work using R and find the connections to others
working with the platform useful. I also host my academic website through GitHub. 
My academic websites can be found at https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/jared-heern and at www.jaredheern.com. 
You can contact me at jcheern@gwu.edu.
